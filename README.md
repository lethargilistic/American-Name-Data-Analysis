# American-Name-Data-Analysis
A collection of practice data analysis scripts

I'm interested in using Python to visualize data, so I'm playing with various features of pyplot to learn more about how to create such things programmatically.

The SSA database of baby names is nice because it is a large set that is consistently formatted. It's simple enough to use, but it's still robust.

Right now, this is sparse, but that's because I've not thought of many questions the data can answer right now. I'll be working on that, too.

# Current Ideas
* Plot the average length of names over time (implemented)
* Plot the counts of male and female names over time. (working on)
* Find the names with 5 people that only appeared in single years, and what years they appeared in.
*
